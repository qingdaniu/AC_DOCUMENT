create an append structure, e.g. ZZACCIT_EXTENSION,and append it to standard structure ACCIT.
In the standard system, some fields of business frontend are not transported to ACCIT,
but we may need this fields, so we append an strucute to ACCIT.
Fields of structure, e.g. Standard fields or Customer ZZ-fields
LGORT:Storage Location
CHARG:Batch Number
GRUND:Reason for Movement
VGBEL:Document number of the reference document
VGPOS:Item number of the reference item
VGTYP:Document category of preceding SD document
ZZ_FIELD1: Customer field1
ZZ_FIELD2: Customer field2
...
...
...
all the above fields are from business frontend, for example mm/sd, 
so we also need do some other enhancements to let the value of these fileds are transported to ACCIT.

1. MM GoodsMovement


2. MM Invoice


3. SD GoodsMovement


4. SD Billing
